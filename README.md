This is a Currency Converter frontend repository for an application where users can select a currency to convert from and another currency to convert to. They can enter the amount they wish to convert, and the result is automatically displayed.

Additionally, the application includes a feature that allows users to store their conversions. It has a login system and provides a list of all conversions made by the logged-in user. Each conversion entry includes the currencies, amounts, and the date and time it occurred.

Important Note: This application does not have the functionality to retrieve updated exchange rates between currencies automatically. Instead, all the exchange rates have been manually inputted into a table called "currencies." The purpose of this design was to practice creating a full-stack application with manual input via an Admin interface. However, I have decided to develop a new version of the application that will utilize API calls to obtain updated exchange rates. I plan to implement this update as soon as possible and will update this Readme accordingly.
